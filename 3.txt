// To Design a datastore to save monitoring data of a service
1. Create two Integration Flows.
2. Connect sender to make the request and choocse https protocols.
3. Use an id for the each user request so that we can identify the user uniquely and monitor the users.

// Get the API with maximum average response time across the users.
1. Per second the users are = 1million / 24*60*60 = 11.57
2. Maximum average response time = 1000 / 11.57 = 86.430
Final maximum average response time across the users = 86.430

// Get the API with maximum average response time for each user.
1. Total there are 1000 users
2. Maximum average response time for each user= 1000/86.430 = 11.57
